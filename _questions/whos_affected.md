question: Who is affected by these vulnerabilities?
---

We looked at the official MEGA Web Client v. 4.11.2 and the MEGA SDK v. 3.9.15.

However, the vulnerabilities are fundamental issues in the cryptographic design.
Clients have only limited implementation flexibility because they need to remain compatible with the server code of MEGA.
Thus, we expect them to be present in all current clients, as well as older versions.
