MEGA or any entity controlling the core infrastructure of MEGA can achieve the following with our attacks:
- Decrypt all files and folders owned by or shared with the victim.
- Decrypt all chat messages exchanged with the victim.
- Forge files that are indistinguishable from genuinely uploaded ones and place them in the victim's cloud storage.
