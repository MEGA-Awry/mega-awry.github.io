question: Isn't this threat model assuming too strong an adversary?

We think the threat model is consistent with the security claims made by MEGA.
For instance, the following quote from their website showcases that MEGA advertise confidentiality of user data even against themselves:
> MEGA does not have access to your password or your data. Using a strong and unique password will ensure that your data is protected from being hacked and gives you total confidence that your information will remain just that -- yours.

Moreover, we must consider the possibility that even if MEGA is not adversarial, their systems may have been compromised by malicious third parties, for example nation state security agencies or hacking groups, who wish to gain access to users' data and files.
Indeed, the sheer size of MEGA -- and the likelihood of it attracting users who wish to protect highly sensitive data precisely because of the security the service claims to offer -- surely make MEGA an attractive target.
