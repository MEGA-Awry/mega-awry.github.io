question: Can I detect whether any of your attacks was exploited on my account?
---

No, almost all of our attacks do not leave persistent traces.
Only the integrity attack may result in files with an unusual structure.
However, this is not a guaranteed indicator of compromise and could be further hidden.

Nevertheless, on the clients that we analyzed, all attacks would have required a substantial number of manual login attempts (i.e., the user entering the password).
Since clients usually cache the credentials, users often stay logged in, minimizing the number of logins performed and thereby increasing the difficulty of the attacks.
